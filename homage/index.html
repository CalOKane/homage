          ⁵New customers to Octopus Energy who purchase an Audi electric vehicle
          and who set up an account for gas and/or electricity and sign up via
          the referral link provided by Audi UK will be eligible for free miles
          in the form of £45 credit per fuel type on their energy account. To

          account is on supply and the first direct debit payment has been
          taken. If you qualify for more than one marketing incentive, Octopus
          reserves the right to give you just one incentive. To benefit from the
          Octopus Go Green tariff, the customer must have a SMETS2 smart meter
          or a SecureTM branded SMETS1 meter that they have agreed to let

          Pro (tethered) with standard installation only or 7kW Ohme ePod
          (untethered) with standard installation only. The availability of

          condition of the existing wiring at the property and the location of
          the nearest electricity point/meter. To find out whether you are
          likely to qualify for standard installation, please visit here;
          https://prismic-io.s3.amazonaws.com/ohme/fd70691a-5246-4b18-a881-72695b4a3d38_Standard+installations.pdf
        </p>
        <p>
          Standard installation is subject to survey. [You will have the option
          to choose between a untethered or tethered unit].
        </p>
        <p>
          Supply, installation and maintenance of the home EV charger will be
          subject to a separate contract between the customer and Ohme. Neither
          Volkswagen Group United Kingdom Limited trading as Audi UK nor the
          Audi Centre can accept any responsibility in connection with that
          contract and any customer queries or claims must be directed to Ohme.
          Customers will need to liaise directly with Ohme in connection with
          survey and installation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Any costs, for example, late cancellation fees, aborted visits,
          physical home surveys, additional accessories, home EV charger
          upgrades, non-standard installation, additional installation works, or
          installation after 2nd October 2023 must be paid for by the customer.
        </p>
        <p>
          If the customer rents their property, then they are responsible for
          obtaining the landlord's permission for the installation. All other
          permissions and consents are also the responsibility of the customer.
        </p>
        <p>
          The home EV charger is only available for installation at a
          residential address owned by the Audi customer (or rented by the Audi
          customer, with the landlord's permission) with off-street parking and
          electrical capacity sufficient to support the home EV charger (unless
          otherwise agreed specifically with Audi UK and Ohme).
        </p>
        <p>
          Home EV chargers are non-transferable and non-refundable and there is
          no cash or other alternative available under this offer. However, Audi
          UK reserves the right to include a different home EV charger and
          installation, of equivalent or greater value, within the offer.
        </p>
        <p>
          If a qualifying vehicle for the offer is cancelled and an alternative
          Audi Approved Used fully electric vehicle is not repurchased in place
          of the cancelled vehicle after installation, then the customer will be
          liable to repay Ohme the fees paid by Audi UK in connection with the
          home EV charger and standard installation. If the customer cancels the
          qualifying purchase before the installation has taken place then no
          charges will be made and they will no longer be entitled to a home EV
          charger with standard installation through this offer. This does not
          affect customers' statutory rights. Installation must take place prior
          to 31st December 2023 in order for customers to receive the benefit of
          the offer.
        </p>

          (EV) chargepoint grant (worth up to £350 – only available to
          homeowners who live in flats and consumers in rental accommodation),
          Audi UK will fund the remaining cost of the home charger with standard

          customers who are eligible and will support them through the grant
          application process.
        </p>
